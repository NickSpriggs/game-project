# UX

My goal for this project was to creaet a simply but fun game that could engage the player. It was my hope that the game would not only
strengthen the users memory and attention but also provide them with entertainment. Specifically my goals were to:
- Create a menu with instructions that allow the user to quickly learn the rules of the game.
- Have a gameplay area separate from the main menu to get engage them undistracted.
- Have a results screen that shows how well they performed.


## User Stories

-   #### First Time User Goals

    2. As a First Time User, I reasonable control over the difficulty.
    3. As a First Time User, I would like to know how well I've down.    

-   #### Returning User Goals

    1. As a Returning User, I want to comfortably access more difficult stages of the game.

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I'd like to get a comprehensive overview of who site the belongs to.
        - The home page immediate introduces the reader to the site owner and provides clear direction to the other pages.
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily find different information about the users work history and experience.    
        -  All the links and external elements function clearly and are unambiguious in their purpose.

## Further Testing

- Project was tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers.

# Deployment

I deployed the project on GitHub using the application GitHub Pages. The steps to do so were as follows:
1.  Log into your GitHub account. 
2.  Go to the repository containing the project.
3.  On the menu bar click the last item entitled "Settings" which will redirect you to the advanced settings page.
4.  Near the bottom of the page you'll find a section aptly titled "GitHub Pages"
5.  Under source change the dropdown menu from "None" to "Main". Then click "Save"
6.  The page will refresh autamatically and if you scroll back down you should see a link to the active site.

In order to make a clone follow the previous section up to step #2:
1.  Above the menu bar containing the "Settings" tab notice the three buttons to the right: "Unwatch", "Star", and "Fork".
2.  Click the "Fork" button and refresh your browser. You will now have a copy of the repository in your own account.
3.  If you have trouble locating the repository just return to the landing page of github and use the search bar.
